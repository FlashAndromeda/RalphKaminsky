A script that screams at you whenever it is sunset.

The ralph.mp3 is necessary, it's the soundbyte played when sunset starts.
Place a shortcut to the script in your autostart folder so it can start with your system.

I know I could've checked current time, sunset time and then calculated how long to wait but I think checking the time every minute and printing out whether it's sunset is way cooler...
